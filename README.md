# Page-View-Time-Series-Visualizer
Pageviews (abbreviated PV) is an online marketing term that refers to the display of a single page or ad and has become a key figure in evaluating online products. PVs do not require any user action and are not assigned to unique visitors. That means one visitor can call up multiple pages during the same visit and thus leave several pageviews.

Since pageviews cannot provide you with clear information about specific user behavior, they are primarily a quantitative analysis method. To perform a qualitative analysis and gather more details about user behavior, you need additional metrics.

This project analyze the dataset of pageview number of fcc forums.
